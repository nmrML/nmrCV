People involved in the term creation from ID >1400000 :

This part of the  NMR ontology was originally developed by the ontology working group (http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/) of the msi-metabolomicssociety (msi-workgroups.sf.net):

Daniel Schober (EBI)
Chris Taylor (EBI and HUPO-PSI)
Dennis Rubtsov (Un of Cambridge, UK)
Helen Jenkins (Un of Wales, Aberystwyth, UK)
Irena Spasic (Center for Integrative Systems Biology, Manchester, UK)
Larissa Soldatova (University of Wales, Aberystwyth, UK)
Philippe Rocca-Serra (EBI and MGED Society)
Susanna-Assunta Sansone (EBI)

People involved in the term creation from ID<1400000:

Joseph Cruz
Daniel Schober
Michael Wilson
Reza Salek
Daniel Jacob
David Wishart

Terms with IDs  ID<1400000 that were NOT asserted in the original Wishart obo file were created by Daniel Schober (COSMOS WP2). Its IDs were autogenerated with the Protege ID generator. 

Other people that substantially helped in revising the latest and Cosmos governed CV additions were:

Michael Wilson, Wishart Group, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada
Daniel Jacob, INRA, Bordeaux, France
Annick Moing, INRA, Bordeaux, France
Catherine Deborde, INRA, Bordeaux, France
Reza Salek, EBI, Hinxton, UK
Philippe Rocca-Serra, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK
Andrea Porzel, IPB-Halle, Germany
and the COSMOS WP2 team

The nmrCV is supporting the nmrML XML format with standardized terms. nmrML is a vendor agnostic open access NMR raw data standard. Its primaly role is analogous to the mzCV for the PSI-approved mzML XML format. It uses BFO2.0 as its Top level. This CV was derived from two predecessors (The NMR CV from the David Wishart Group, developed by Joseph Cruz) and the MSI nmr CV developed by Daniel Schober at the EBI. This simple taxonomy of terms (no DL semantics used) serves the nuclear magnetic resonance markup language (nmrML) with meaningful descriptors to amend the nmrML xml file with CV terms. Metabolomics scientists are encouraged to use this CV to annotrate their raw and experimental context data, i.e. within nmrML. The approach to have an exchange syntax mixed of an xsd and CV stems from the PSI mzML effort. The reason to branch out from an xsd into a CV is, that in areas where the terminology is likely to change faster than the nmrML xsd could be updated and aligned, an externally and decentrallised maintained CV can accompensate for such dynamics in a more flexible way. A second reason for this set-up is that semantic validity of CV terms used in an nmrML XML instance (allowed CV terms, position/relation to each other, cardinality) can be validated by rule-based proprietary validators: By means of cardinality specifications and XPath expressions defined in an XML mapping file (an instances of the CvMappingRules.xsd ), one can define what ontology terms are allowed in a specific location of the data model." ;
